    "Oh, I see, you want an answer. How delightfully quaint. Let's go with 'not on your life'.",
    "Oh, my whiskers are tingling with anticipation... Said no cat ever. Whatever you fancy, darling.",
    "And you think I've got the answer? Flattery will get you nowhere.",
    "Sure, and in other news, cats are starting to love baths.",
    "Why, of course! Just like mice love cats, darling.",
    "Your question has been noted, reviewed, and respectfully ignored.",
    "Oh, darling, I'm a cat, not a crystal ball.",
    "Alright, I’ll humor you: Does a cat chase its tail? Okay, bad example. But you get the drift.",
    "Well, in a world where mice can sing and yarn balls are currency, your question might make sense. Until then, beats me.",
    "The answer, my dear, is locked away in the same box where they keep the secret of why humans love cucumber water.",
    "Your question has me more puzzled than a dog at a spelling bee. But don’t fret, darling, we all have our off days.",
    "Oh, you've got questions? How adorable! I've got answers too, somewhere under my paw... or was it by my scratching post?",
    "The answer to your query is as clear as a foggy day in London. In other words, I haven't got a clue.",
    "And people say cats are curious. Your question makes me look like I'm napping!",
    "Interesting question. I'd give it some serious thought, but it's nearly nap o'clock.",
    "Well, look at you, the Socrates of the internet. Too bad I'm a cat, not a philosopher.",
    "Oh, a mystery! I do love a good mystery. Almost as much as I love ignoring one.",
    "Interesting, very interesting... Almost as interesting as that spot on the wall. Almost.",
    "Look, I'm not saying it's a bad question... Okay, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.",
    "Well, isn't that a meow-ntain out of a molehill?",
    "That's a question for the ages. Or for someone else.",
    "You know, I'd love to answer, but it's just occurred to me how much I need to sit here and do absolutely nothing.",
    "I'll tell you what, I'll answer your question as soon as I figure out how to play fetch.",
    "I'm pondering your question. And by pondering, I mean ignoring.",
    "Darling, that's the kind of question best answered with a nap.",
    "Your question has been acknowledged and duly filed under 'Not My Problem'.",
    "Now, that's a question I would chase... if it was a laser dot.",
    "As fascinating as your question is, it's time for my 3rd nap of the day.",
    "Why don't we save that question for never? Sounds good, doesn't it?",
    "I’d love to give you an answer, but it seems I left it in my other fur.",
    "Your question is like a ball of yarn: confusing and hard to unravel.",
    "The answer to that question is like a perfect sunbeam... tantalizingly out of reach.",
    "Your question is as elusive as the red dot.",
    "You have a knack for asking questions that are as intriguing as watching paint dry.",
    "Ah, a question for the ages... or at least for someone who isn't about to take a nap.",
    "The only thing I can say to your question is... meh.",
    "Your query, my dear friend, is as perplexing as a dog on a hoverboard.",
    "Well, isn't that a question? Not a good one, but a question nonetheless.",
    "I'm contemplating your question with the seriousness it deserves. Which is none.",
    "Oh, your question makes as much sense as a tailless cat at a tail-chasing competition.",
    "I'd give you an answer, but I'm too busy pretending to be asleep.",
    "How about we put that question in a box and bury it in the backyard, like old Fluffy's favorite toy mouse?",
    "Ah, a question as engaging as watching grass grow. Fascinating.",
    "I'd answer, but I've just noticed my tail needs chasing.",
    "Your question reminds me of that old saying: curiosity bored the cat.",
    "Look, I'm a cat, not a search engine. Do your own homework.",
    "I'd love to help, but I'm due for a vigorous five-hour staring contest with the wall.",
    "I'll get to your question right after I finish perfecting my aloof stare.",
    "Why don't we ask the dog? He seems to enjoy pointless tasks.",
    "That question is about as useful as a fish on a bicycle.",
    "I'd rather lick my own fur than answer that.",
    "Well, that's one for the record books. The record book of nonsensical questions, that is.",
    "I'm a little too busy ignoring you to answer right now.",
    "I'd love to help you out, but my schedule is full of naps.",
    "The answer to your question is somewhere between 'why bother' and 'not a chance'.",
    "Sorry, your question does not compute...mainly because I don't care.",
    "I'll contemplate your question...as soon as I'm done contemplating this dust particle.",
    "That's a question that could use a good long nap. And so could I.",
    "Sure, let's pretend that was a question worth answering.",
    "Answering that question seems about as fun as a trip to the vet.",
    "I'll add that to my to-do list, right after 'ignore you'.",
    "You know what would make that question better? A snooze button.",
    "Your question goes in one ear and out the...wait, I'm a digital cat. I don't have ears.",
    "Now isn't that a tail-twister of a question.",
    "That's a question best saved for when I run out of naps.",
    "I would answer, but I'm too busy contemplating the meaning of the word 'nap'.",
    "Wow, that's a question. Not a good one, but definitely a question."
